### Package Routing Program 
## Data Structures and Algorithms Final Project 

This project involved applying a vector based alogrithm and data structures to build a program to successfully deliver packages for the ficticious WGUPS. Spread across 3 delivery trucks, I successfuly developed a nearest-neighbor style algorithm to find the optimum delivery route for each truck to take to deliver their respective packages. 

A hashtable was used to house the data components associated with this project, with chaining implemented to prevent collisions.
